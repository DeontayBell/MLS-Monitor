API: We subscribed to the "Major League Soccer Standings" API from RapidAPI.

PURPOSE: Display easy to ready rankings & stats for every team in Major League Soccer.

INTENDED MARKET: Soccer / Football / FÃºtbol fans in the United States, Canada & Mexico. With the arrival of Leo Messi in Miami & the upcoming World Cup in '26 that's hosted by the previously mentioned trio; fans new & old need a new way to follow the teams they love.

STRETCH GOALS: Adding an 'About' page to showcase each individual teammates portfolio & our team's repository on Gitlab would be a good addition to this neat little application of ours. Configuring it so you can click on the Submit button inside of the Create Account & Login page instead of having to type enter on your keyboard every time would be a plus too.

GITLAB REPOSITORY: https://gitlab.com/hack-reactor-hacks-18/mls-monitor
