    Got everything setup. Skeleton is configured in vscode, everyone has cloned the repo & we added in Riley, Michael & Josh as members in Gitlab too. Everyone has created their journals & we are ready to go. This project will monitor the standings of all 30 teams in the MLS (Major League Soccer), the biggest soccer league in the U.S.A & Canada.

<!-- 8/15/23
    Working on getting Docker up & running. Trying to get the .yml file organized but it's proving to be more difficult than expected. Looked over lessons from Riley for some inspiration & eventually we got everything figured it out.
 -->


<!-- 8/16/23
    We got the authorization almost set up & running with MongoDB. I need to keep watching the videos with Curtis as the main character & also check out the pokemon project from Riley for references on everything that we covered in class. I had to check out around 8pm est & call it a day.
 -->


<!-- 8/17/23
    Authorization is up & running now thanks to the resilience of my partner Deontay & the videos from our instructor Riley. We're working on tidying up the backend up now & discussing what we should be doing for next week. We're off to a good start & I'm happy with all the progress we've made so far.

<!-- 8/21/23
    Team got around to creating all of our models & placed them inside of our models.py file. We encountered a bug in of our other files though & had to work with the SEIR's for a bit but eventually figured it out. We agreed to call it a night when they bell rang at 9pm EST.
 -->


<!-- 8/22/23
    I had a doctor's appointment & unofrtunately had to miss a decent chunk of the day. My teammeates worked diligently to get our backend to successfully pull data from our Major League Soccer Standings API that we found on RapidAPI. Started working on the comments function up until closing time.
 -->


<!-- 8/23/23
    Today we focused most of our energy on getting our comments function to work. After we wrote some code in comments.py in our queries folder & comments.py in our routers folder, we ran into some trouble on Docker when we tried launching it but the mongo containers weren't having it. Deontay figured out a way to get it all working though, I need to ask him to explain it to me again.
 -->


 <!-- 8/24/23
    Today I worked on making a READ.ME file for the group. I looked at some other projects & after awhile assembled something I felt was appropriate. My teammates looked it over & we made some edits to it to make sure it's concise. We checked up on the back end to make sure that we're all set to move forward on the frontend & immediately started creating an HTML skeleton for everything to fit inside of. + we started a MLS.css file to likewise start styling our project.
 -->


  <!-- 8/25/23
    We started working on creating all of our unit tests & we've got most of them completed by the end of the day today, but the one's pertaining to comments are giving us the most trouble but we're determined to figure this out & get our project to be ready for testing.
 -->

  <!-- 8/28/23
    We picked up where we left off with the final unit tests but by the end of the day we actually still couldn't figure out what the deal was.
 -->

  <!-- 8/29/23
    Our group huddle / standup started early around 11:30am & we brainstormed on how to finish up the unit tests, but we still couldn't crack the code so we went to visit the instructors to get their advice. After awhile we re-evaluated what we had, simplified it & then got it to work. Now on to the front end of everything. We got our nav.js file started along with making some other important javascript files.
 -->

  <!-- 8/30/23
    We split up & started working on the most important pages of the frontend: Nav.js, Login.js, Logout.js & CreateAccount.js. I started making what could be a functioning nav.js file, but I need to also work inside app.js & create a useToken.js page. We got the login page to work which is an amazing step forward. Now we need to build of it to get the nav inside of it running, a table to hold the login form & footer, same goes for the rest of the main javascript pages we're currenly working with.
 -->

  <!-- 8/31/23
   Today I got deep into configuring our nav.js file. After watching a lot more from Riley's video on Redux, I assembled an apiSplice.js file, store.js & searchSlice.js file. Then I realized I needed to do some tinkering with the index.js file too. After getting most of that done, we grouped back together to do the ol' push / pull routine & get everyone caught up. I need to keep watching that redux video though because not only do I need to learn a little more but our frontend pages still aren't connected to nav.js either.
