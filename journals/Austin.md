    Got everything setup. Skeleton is configured in vscode, everyone has cloned the repo & we added in Riley, Michael & Josh as members in Gitlab too. Everyone has created their journals & we are ready to go. This project will monitor the standings of all 30 teams in the MLS (Major League Soccer), the biggest soccer league in the U.S.A & Canada.
-->


<!-- 8/15/23
    Working on getting Docker up & running. Trying to get the .yml file organized but it's proving to be more difficult than expected. Looked over lessons from Riley for some inspiration & eventually we got everything figured it out.
 -->


<!-- 8/16/23
    We got the authorization almost set up & running with MongoDB. I need to keep watching the videos with Curtis as the main character & also check out the pokemon project from Riley for references on everything that we covered in class. I had to check out around 8pm est & call it a day.
 -->


<!-- 8/17/23
    Authorization is up & running now thanks to the resilience of my partner Deontay & the videos from our instructor Riley. We're working on tidying up the backend up now & discussing what we should be doing for next week. We're off to a good start & I'm happy with all the progress we've made so far.
 -->


<!-- 8/21/23
    Team got around to creating all of our models & placed them inside of our models.py file. We encountered a bug in of our other files though & had to work with the SEIR's for a bit but eventually figured it out. We agreed to call it a night when they bell rang at 9pm EST.
 -->


<!-- 8/22/23
    I had a doctor's appointment & unofrtunately had to miss a decent chunk of the day. My teammeates worked diligently to get our backend to successfully pull data from our Major League Soccer Standings API that we found on RapidAPI. Started working on the comments function up until closing time.
 -->


<!-- 8/23/23
    Today we focused most of our energy on getting our comments function to work. After we wrote some code in comments.py in our queries folder & comments.py in our routers folder, we ran into some trouble on Docker when we tried launching it but the mongo containers weren't having it. Deontay figured out a way to get it all working though, I need to ask him to explain it to me again.
 -->


 <!-- 8/24/23
    Today I worked on making a READ.ME file for the group. I looked at some other projects & after awhile assembled something I felt was appropriate. My teammates looked it over & we made some edits to it to make sure it's concise. We checked up on the back end to make sure that we're all set to move forward on the frontend & immediately started creating an HTML skeleton for everything to fit inside of. + we started a MLS.css file to likewise start styling our project.
 -->


  <!-- 8/25/23
    We started working on creating all of our unit tests & we've got most of them completed by the end of the day today, but the one's pertaining to comments are giving us the most trouble but we're determined to figure this out & get our project to be ready for testing.
 -->


  <!-- 8/28/23
    We picked up where we left off with the final unit tests but by the end of the day we actually still couldn't figure out what the deal was.
 -->


  <!-- 8/29/23
    Our group huddle / standup started early around 11:30am & we brainstormed on how to finish up the unit tests, but we still couldn't crack the code so we went to visit the instructors to get their advice. After awhile we re-evaluated what we had, simplified it & then got it to work. Now on to the front end of everything. We got our nav.js file started along with making some other important javascript files.
 -->


  <!-- 8/30/23
    We split up & started working on the most important pages of the frontend: Nav.js, Login.js, Logout.js & CreateAccount.js. I started making what could be a functioning nav.js file, but I need to also work inside app.js & create a useToken.js page. We got the login page to work which is an amazing step forward. Now we need to build of it to get the nav inside of it running, a table to hold the login form & footer, same goes for the rest of the main javascript pages we're currenly working with.
 -->


  <!-- 8/31/23
   Today I got deep into configuring our nav.js file. After watching a lot more from Riley's video on Redux, I assembled an apiSplice.js file, store.js & searchSlice.js file. Then I realized I needed to do some tinkering with the index.js file too. After getting most of that done, we grouped back together to do the ol' push / pull routine & get everyone caught up. I need to keep watching that redux video though because not only do I need to learn a little more but our frontend pages still aren't connected to nav.js either.
 -->


  <!-- 9/5/23
    After our practice test today we regrouped & started watching Riley's video on React Redux again to get a better understanding of how all this frontend stuff works. We're mostly finished at this point, but we still have maybe a day's worth of work at most to start moving forward & making each page more intricate & finally styling it all. We are diverging from our original path slighty too whereas originally commenting was one of the main features of an account. Now it will be for favorites becuase in the future we don't want to have to monitor user behavior.
 -->


<!-- 9/6/23
    We're making a lot of progress on gettting redux setup but its proving to be tougher than expected. At this point, we think most of our errors are coming down to naming convention issues, but its possible we're wrong too. Met with the SEIR's who helped point us in the right direction, we're fixing the rest now. The team pulled through today Mariam, Deontay, Ethan & we finally got redux up & running. Now it's time to make everything pretty.
 -->


  <!-- 9/7/23
    I started off by adding in an error page, Deontay got the login function to start working. & now we are going back & looking through the entire project to tidy it up & make sure we are following the project rubric requirements completely. Then we will venture back to the frontend again & start making the other pages look good, followed by adding in the CSS on the final day, Monday. The unit tests took a lot longer to configure then expected. We have two that are still working, but since we reverted back to using favorites over comments, we had to change ours. We'll finish the unit tests up tomorrow in the morning.
 -->


  <!-- 9/8/23
    This morning I was able to finish making the unit tests which I was really proud of. I wasn't mocking the fake data correctly as I initially thought it could be less precise. Now we're trying to get the Team Detail page to work to ensure all of our frontend pages are running properly at the base level. As of today, Create Account, Login & Home are good, but Team Detail is the last major hurdle. Once it's good, we'll begin making the Home page more detailed along with the others. We incurred some git issues towards the end of the day, but thankfully we were able to resolve them thanks to some guidance from the SEIRs too.
 -->


 <!-- 9/9/23
    We met up in the afternoon on Saturday & got everyone's projects up to date by pushing & pulling etc. We did a run through of the site together & can happily announce that the Home Page is up, the Create Account page is working & most importantly so far, you can login & logout successfully. Deontay is working on the Search bar, Mariam is working on the CSS & Ethan & I are working on the Home Page to get all the teams with their rankings showing. Tomorrow we'll meet again in the afternoon & work on the frontend some more while on Monday we'll do some house cleaning with the site, take a tour of the site again & finish polishing the front.
 -->


  <!-- 9/10/23
    Last day of the weekend to work on this ol' project of ours. Got together in the evening & started to work on the home detail page. Ethan created an Issue in Gitlab & I went to resolve it later that night but we still had some work to do. Mariam made the login & create account forms look really nice with CSS. In the meantime, I scanned our files for unncessary comments, console logs & print statements. There weren't many left, but that's another small thing taken care of too. Ethan worked until really late at night & got most of the frontend working.
