    Got everything setup. Skeleton is configured in vscode, everyone has cloned the repo
    & we added in Riley, Michael & Josh as members in Gitlab too. Everyone has created
    their journals & we are ready to go. This project will monitor the standings
    of all 30 teams in the MLS (Major League Soccer), the biggest soccer league in the U.S.A & Canada.

<!-- 8/15/23
    Working on getting Docker up & running. Trying to get the .yml file organized but it's proving to be more difficult than expected. Looked over lessons from Riley for some inspiration & eventually figured it out.
 -->


<!-- 8/16/23
    We got the authorization almost set up & running with MongoDB. I need to keep watching the videos with Curtis & check out the pokemon project from Riley for references on everything. Had to check out around 8pm est & call it a day.
 -->


<!-- 8/17/23
    Authorization is up & running now thanks to the resilience of my partner Deontay & our instructor Riley. Tidying up the backend up & now preparing for next week. We're off to a good start & I'm happy with all the progress we've made so far.
 -->


<!-- 8/21/23
    We got around to creating all of our models & placed them inside of our models.py file. We encountered a bug in our .file & had to work with the SEIR's for a bit but figured it out. Called it a night around 9pm EST.
 -->


<!-- 8/22/23
    I had a doctor's appointment & had to miss a chunk of the day. My teammeates worked diligently to get our backend to successfully pull data from our Major League Soccer Standings API that we found on RapidAPI. Started working on the comments function up until closing time.
 -->


<!-- 8/23/23
    Today we focused most of our energy on getting our comments function to work. After we wrote some code in comments.py in our queries folder & comments.py in our routers folder, we ran into some trouble on Docker when we tried launching it but the mongo containers weren't having it. Deontay figured out a way to get it all working though, I need to ask him to explain it to me again.
 -->


 <!-- 8/24/23
    Today I worked on making a READ.ME file for the group. I looked at some other projects & after awhile assembled something I felt was appropriate. My teammates looked it over & we made some edits to it to make sure it's concise. We checked up on the back end to make sure that we're all set to move forward on the frontend & immediately started creating an HTML skeleton for everything to fit inside of. + we started a MLS.css file to likewise start styling our project.
 -->


  <!-- 8/25/23
    We started working on our unit tests & got most of them completed by the end of the day, but the one's pertaining to comments gave us the most trouble.
 -->

  <!-- 8/28/23
    We picked up where we left off with the final unit tests but by the end of the day we actually still couldn't figure out what the deal was.
 -->

  <!-- 8/29/23
    Our group huddle / standup started early around 11:30am & we brainstormed on how to finish up the unit tests, but we still couldn't crack the code so we went to visit the instructors to get their advice. After awhile we re-evaluated what we had, simplified it & then got it to work. Now on to the front end of everything.
