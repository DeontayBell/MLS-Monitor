Today, I was involved in:

Collaboratively establishing the project structure with the group
All team members initiated journal entries and created their respective branches.

August 15, 2023
Today, I focused on:

Initiating the authentication process
The team collectively decided to collaborate on all project aspects and planned to rotate the driver's role.

August 16, 2023
Today, my efforts were directed towards:

Completing the authentication process
We followed Curtis' video and Riley's recording on backend authentication but encountered a recurring "missing value error" for the hashed_password. We sought assistance from SEIRs, but the issue remained unresolved.

August 17, 2023
Today, I concentrated on:

Successfully concluding the authentication process
The team worked with Riley based on the recommendations of SEIRs and identified a minor typo in the accounts.py file within the queries directory.

August 18, 2023
Today, my focus remained on:

Successfully concluding the authentication process
The team continued to work with Riley following SEIRs' advice and identified a minor typo in the accounts.py file within the queries directory.

August 21, 2023
Today, I worked on:

Model creation and troubleshooting
We collectively developed the required models and placed them in the "models.py" file. We encountered a bug during troubleshooting with SEIRs, which extended our work beyond the end of the day.

August 22, 2023
Today, I was engaged in:

Integrating the backend API
We dedicated our efforts to integrating our backend endpoints with the MLS Standings API from RapidAPI.

August 23, 2023
Today, my focus was on:

Enhancing the comments functionality
I refined the comments feature and created a "comments.py" file in both the queries and routers directories. The development of the MongoDB Express code required substantial time and involved extensive online research.

August 24, 2023
Today, I dedicated my time to:

Documentation and initiating frontend development
Austin initiated the README file, and the entire team contributed to its content. We also commenced minimal frontend work by creating the MLS.css file.

August 25, 2023
Today, I started:

Creating unit tests
I began developing unit tests, and by the end of the day, two out of the four tests were fully functional. However, we encountered issues with tests related to our comments function, which we planned to address in the following week.

August 28, 2023
Today, I focused on:

Resolving errors in unit tests
I spent the entire day working on resolving errors in the last two tests, with the whole team troubleshooting the issues without success. We decided to consult SEIRs or instructors the next day.

August 29, 2023
Today, I worked on:

Finalizing unit tests and commencing frontend development
I discussed unit test issues with Michael and gained clarity. I simplified the problematic test, which was causing errors despite having correct code, resulting in fully functional tests. I also began work on the "nav.js" file, shifting my focus to frontend development.

August 30, 2023
Today, my focus was on:

Developing frontend pages
Each team member took responsibility for specific frontend features, and I started working on the "CreateAccount.js" file. Additionally, I contributed to the "Nav.js" and "index.js" files. As frontend is not my strong suit, I had to review recordings from Riley's Pokemon project extensively.

August 31, 2023
Today, my efforts were directed towards:

Refining the frontend
I encountered challenges in getting the create account functionality to work due to endpoint mismatches, requiring me to thoroughly examine both frontend and backend components. While making progress, a few errors still persisted.

September 5, 2023
Today, I focused on:

Exploring Redux
I spent a significant amount of time reviewing numerous recordings and Learn modules to gain a basic understanding of Redux. Although I didn't write much code, I still have some uncertainties about Redux.

September 6, 2023
Today, my efforts were directed towards:

Delving deeper into Redux
As expected, setting up Redux proved challenging, and we needed to address issues such as naming conventions. We sought assistance from SEIRs to resolve errors related to endpoints.

September 7, 2023
Today, I contributed to:

Implementing login functionality
Primarily following Deontay's lead, our team worked through errors on the login page. We had to make adjustments to backend endpoints and modify the login.jsx file after consulting with SEIRs. We successfully made the Login page and Create Account page operational.

September 8, 2023
Today, I focused on:

Enhancing the functionality of the home page
I made code modifications in the Home.jsx, TeamCard.jsx, TeamList.jsx, index.js, Nav.jsx, and App.jsx files to introduce new features on the home page. I shared my changes with the team, and we continued working on the TeamDetails.jsx file before finalizing the styling. We anticipated working over the weekend.

September 11, 2023
Today, I was engaged in:

Integrating CSS styling into the home page
Improved our understanding of implementing CSS styling into the team detail page. The team worked together to close issues in GitLab and finalized journal entries and documentation, marking the completion of the project.
