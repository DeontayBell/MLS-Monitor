    Got everything setup. Skeleton is configured in vscode, everyone has cloned the repo
    & we added in Riley, Michael & Josh as members in Gitlab too. Everyone has created
    their journals & we are ready to go. This project will monitor the standings
    of all 30 teams in the MLS (Major League Soccer), the biggest soccer league in the U.S.A & Canada.

    Working on getting Docker up & running. Trying to get the .yml file organized but it's proving to be more difficult than expected. Looked over lessons from Riley for some inspiration & eventually figured it out.

    We got the authorization almost set up & running with MongoDB. I need to keep watching the videos with Curtis & check out the pokemon project from Riley for references on everything. Had to check out around 8pm est & call it a day.

    Authorization is up & running now thanks to the resilience of my partner Deontay & our instructor Riley. Tidying up the backend up & now preparing for next week. We're off to a good start & I'm happy with all the progress we've made so far.
