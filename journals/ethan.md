## August 16, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Finishing authentication

The group followed along with Curtis' video and Riley's recording on backend authentication. Got stuck with recurring "missing value error" for the hashed_password. Worked with SEIRs who also could not resolve issue.

## August 17, 2023

We collectively created the required models and placed them in "models.py" file. He had to troubleshoot a bug with SEIRs which took us well past end of day.

## August 22, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Backedn API integration

We worked on integrating our backend endpoints with MLS Standings API from RapidAPI.

## August 23, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Enhancing the comments functionality

Refined comments feature and created "comments.py" file in queries and routers directories. Developing mongoDB express code took time to figure out. Googled a lot.

## August 24, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Documentation and frontend initiation

Austin initiated README file and the group contributed to its content. Started minimal frontend work with MLS.css file.

## August 25, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Unit testing

Began creating unit tests. By the end of the day we had two of the four completely working. The tests related to our comments function are giving issues. We will readress next week.

## August 28, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Resolving unit testing errors

Spent all day working on the last two tests' errors. Everyone has been troubleshooting the errors to no avail. We will consult SEIRs or instructors tomorrow.

## August 29, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Finalizing unit tests and frontend development

Spoke with Michael about unit test issues and gained clarity. Simplified the lone test that was causing errors despite correct code and have fully functioning tests. Began work in "nav.js" file to shift focus to frontend.

## August 30, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Frontend page development

Everyone took a specific frontend feature to initiate, so I began the "CreateAccount.js" file. I had to contribute to the "Nav.js" and "index.js" file as well. I am not great with front end so I had to review a lot of recordings from Riley's pokemon project.

## August 31, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Refining the frontend

I had to troubleshoot errors getting the create account functionality to work. The endpoints were not matching up so I had to examine the frontend and backend again. Making progress but still have a couple errors.

## September 5, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Pivoting to Redux, apparently

I had to review A LOT of recordings and Learn modules to understand a bit of Redux. Didn't code a lot, and still don't fully get Redux.

## September 6, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Reduxing, still

As anticipated, setting up Redux was challenging. We have to address simple issues like naming conventions still. We had to meet with SEIRs for errors we were receiving that ultimatley had to do with endpoint issues.

## September 7, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Login functionality

Mainly following Deontay's lead, the group worked through errors on the login page. We had to address some backend endpoints as well as tweak the login.jsx file after speaking with SEIRs. Now the Login page and Create Account page work.

## September 8, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Home page functionality

I had to modify some code in the Home.jsx, TeamCard.jsx, TeamList.jsx, index.js, Nav.jsx, and App.jsx files to get some functionality in the Home page. I shared my changes with the group and now we are working on the TeamDetails.jsx file before finishing up styling. We will have to work over the weekend.

## September 9, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Integrating Team List statistics into the Home page

I am struggling to integrate information from the API into the Home page. Currently it is not displaying any information or listing team information as we planned in our wireframe. I believe it has to do with the level of information we are getting from the API. I will continue to troubleshoot tomorrow.

## September 10, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Integrating API info into the Home page

After tons of research I learned we were not reaching into the API dictionary to the appropriate level. Our API is essentially providing team information within two dictionaries: an eastern conference dictionary and a western conference dictionary with multiple entries in each which contain the teams themselves with associated stats. I adjusted code within the Home.jsx and TeamCard.jsx files and can now see the desired information on the Home page.....I hate how long this took.

## September 11, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Integrating CSS styling into the Home page

I worked with Mariam to better understand how to implement CSS styling into the Home page. The team then coordinated in closing issues in GitLab and finalized journal entries and documentation to complete project.

## September 13, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- A job test while the team presented

The team presented our project today and secured a passing grade.
